### Ionic, AngularJS and Cordova Seed Project

For most of these tutorials, we will be using the official [ionic-angular-cordova-seed](http://github.com/driftyco/ionic-angular-cordova-seed) project on GitHub. This project sets you up with a working example Ionic app that uses [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) to build to a native app.

To start, download or clone the [seed project](http://github.com/driftyco/ionic-angular-cordova-seed) and open the directory it downloaded or extracted to. The seed project comes with an example app that has some functionality built in that we won't need, so you can remove these files, or use them as a starting point for your own app.

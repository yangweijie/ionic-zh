Have you been burning to know how to use Ionic's navigation system to its fullest? Tabs, side menus, lists, and the complexities of mobile development got you down? Search no longer. Today we are launching [Learn Ionic](http://learn.ionicframework.com), a resource for learning everything there is to know about Ionic.

### A Place to Learn

Since becoming Ionic's developer evangelist, it's been my goal for every developer wanting to use Ionic to have the resources they need to use it, make apps, and master it. There's a lot going on in the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and Ionic ecosystem, and learning to create world-class hybrid mobile applications can be daunting. That's where Learn Ionic comes in - a constant supply of screencasts and articles with new information. It may be a simple directive you get stuck on, or find yourself customizing the underpinnings of Ionic's navigation system - either way, we've got you covered.

### Focused on You

The emphasis of Learn Ionic was on the developer. We rounded up our most asked questions from developers everywhere and are focused on answering those first. Turns out, there were a lot of those questions, and there are many more about using Ionic. I'm out to find the problems itching and bothering our community, and clarifying them for everybody. Your suggestions are going to be what makes Learn Ionic, so for now please get in contact with us via a [Github Issue](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-learn/issues/new). Put simply: the more questions you ask, the better it is for everyone!

Learn Ionic is also a living site. It's built for developers, and the feedback you give ultimately makes it a better tool for you. Learn Ionic is [open source](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-learn), and the issue tracker is open to all who want to improve it to suit their needs better.

### Bite sized

Over time, Learn Ionic will get filled with [videos](http://learn.ionicframework.com/videos/) and [articles](http://learn.ionicframework.com/formulas/) that will strengthen you as both an Ionic and AngularJS developer. You also have deadlines, software to develop, and a life to live. One of the goals in setting off to build Learn Ionic was to keep everything straight forward and to the point. For simple problems, you may find something that can be easily copied and pasted into your app. When those harder problems arise, diving into a Formula about it may help you understand what's really going on. Either way, our promise is for videos and articles to be simple and to the point, without cutting corners on the important details you need to know.

### Interactive

I am a kinesthetic learner. Reading and listening to content is great, but being able to experiment and break is even better. For this, we developed Scratchpad, an interactive part of Learn Ionic that contains the relevant code for an article, letting you preview and modify it as the developer. Want to really understand what happens when you change a directive's properties? I do too, and having a sandbox to do it in-line makes it that much easier to get the feedback you need. Scratchpad is perfect for quickly getting dirty with your Ionic apps, but more on that later...

Today we are incredibly excited to welcome [Andy Joslin](http://ajoslin.com/) ([@ajoslin](https://github.com/ajoslin) on github) to the Ionic Core team!

Andy is an AngularJS veteran, having used it since the 1.0 release. He's also been a contributor to the [angular-ui/bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) project and is an avid fan of open source, having created several popular mobile open source projects in the past.

Andy works from his home office in Raleigh, North Carolina, and when not coding loves running, climbing, tough mudder, travelling, and thinking of new puns.

Expect to see [@ajoslin](https://github.com/ajoslin) on Ionic commits, fixing issues and working on some big important features in the framework.

Once again, welcome Andy, and we are excited to have you help make Ionic the best mobile app framework in the world!

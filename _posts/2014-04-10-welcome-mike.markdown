Today, we're excited to announce that Mike Hartington ([@mhartington](https://twitter.com/mhartington) on Twitter, [@mhartington](https://github.com/mhartington) on GitHub, and [mhartington](http://forum.ionicframework.com/users/mhartington/activity)  on the Forum) has joined Ionic as a Community Manager! If you haven't already interacted with him on the [Forum](forum.ionicframework.com), expect to see him there more often. He'll be helping out on a daily basis fielding questions/ideas/suggestions, creating inspirational demos, and of course, sling'n code.

Mike is a front end web developer, with a background in tradional design. Thus, Mike strives to create efficient and performant CSS while at the same time keeping the visual UI in mind (which is perfect for a design-aware framework like Ionic). He hails from the enterprise world, where he worked on internal mobile applications built on Ionic, of course!

Residing out of Rhode Island, USA, Mike loves playing or building guitars, doing sculpture work, and making wood carvings. Yep, he's a badass.

So with that, help us welcome Mike to the team!

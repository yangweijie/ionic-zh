Tomorrow night, [@maxlynch](http://twitter.com/maxlynch) will be presenting Ionic at the [AngularMN](http://www.meetup.com/AngularMN/events/169844302/) meetup group in Saint Paul, MN. If you're in the area, stop by (though space is almost full!)

If you can't make the meetup, we are having an Ionic Drinkup after at [The Bulldog bar](https://www.google.com/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&q=The+Bulldog+Lowertown&fb=1&gl=us&hq=the+bulldog+saint+paul&cid=13528608539129420365&ei=5g47U4L8FOe-2wW9mYDgBw&ved=0CJcBEPwSMAs) in downtown Saint Paul, starting around 8:30. Join us for free drinks and some Ionic swag!

Hope to see you there!

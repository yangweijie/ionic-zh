  nav-clear



</h1>





nav-clear is an attribute directive which should be used with an element that changes
the view on click, for example an `<a href>` or a `<button ui-sref>`.

nav-clear will cause the given element, when clicked, to disable the next view transition.
This directive is useful, for example, for links within a sideMenu.

Below is a link in a side menu, with the nav-clear directive added to it.
Tapping this link will disable any animations that would normally occur
between views.

<a nav-clear menu-close href="#/home" class="item">Home</a>
```

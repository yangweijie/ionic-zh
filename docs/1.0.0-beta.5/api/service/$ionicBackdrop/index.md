  $ionicBackdrop



</h1>





Shows and hides a backdrop over the UI.  Appears behind popups, loading,
and other overlays.

Often, multiple UI components require a backdrop, but only one backdrop is
ever needed in the DOM at a time.

Therefore, each component that requires the backdrop to be shown calls
`$ionicBackdrop.retain()` when it wants the backdrop, then `$ionicBackdrop.release()`
when it is done with the backdrop.

For each time `retain` is called, the backdrop will be shown until `release` is called.

For example, if `retain` is called three times, the backdrop will be shown until `release`
is called three times.









## Usage
```js
function MyController($scope, $ionicBackdrop, $timeout) {
  //Show a backdrop for one second
  $scope.action = function() {
    $ionicBackdrop.retain();
    $timeout(function() {
      $ionicBackdrop.release();
    }, 1000);
  };
}
```
